[b]Addon Name:[/b] barny's CC Tracker

[b]Description:[/b]
barnys CC Tracker is the addon for [i]YOU[/i] to help you keep track of crowd control (CC) effects during combat. CC effects include abilities like stuns, snares, and roots that temporarily limit your character’s movement or actions. This addon displays icons whenever your character is affected by a CC ability, letting you know which effect is active. It also tracks when a CC ends, updating the display automatically. This helps you react faster in combat by knowing exactly what kind of effect is limiting you.
